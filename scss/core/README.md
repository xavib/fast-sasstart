# Core Partials

Take as a rule-of-thumb that if a sass partial does not print anything into a CSS compiled file, it belongs here.

## Typical contents

File              | Purpose
----------------- | ---------------------------------------------
`_functions.scss` | SASS functions.
`_variables.scss` | To hold site-wide variables
`_mixins.scss`    | To hold mixins.
