# What

A base set of SCSS stylesheets to start projects. No frameworks or learning curve, just a set of empty files to be customised as you need and a couple of handy mixins and functions.

## How

``gem install compass``

or

``gem install sass``

All the code is in the SASS folder. User config.rb to customise your settings if you will run **compass watch** (defaults to /stylesheets) or just run **sass --watch sass:[your css folder]** if you don't want the compass thing.

## Credits

This codebase has been curated by @xavi_b, and comes from several sources. Mostly based in [@eddiemachado's Bones](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) clever structure but there's also a little from [Zurb's Foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation) (the grid), and some other stuff coming from here and there.
